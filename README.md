# Design Excel Files

This repository is a growing collection of tools (primarily in Excel) designed to assist with common civil engineering design problems.

## ðŸ“Œ What kind of design problems are included?

The tools here focus on problems typically introduced at the undergraduate level of civil engineering education. However, the goal is to go beyond classroom examples by incorporating complete design workflowsâ€”including codal provisions and common industry practices.

For instance, a tool for singly reinforced concrete beam design (under a given bending moment) will not just calculate the required reinforcement but also:
- Proportion the cross-section
- Suggest placement of reinforcement bars
- Provide a bar bending schedule
- Ensure ductile detailing requirements are met

## ðŸŽ¯ Why was this repository created?

To automate parts of routine civil engineering design calculations that may benefit from consistency and speed

## ðŸ”­ What to expect in the future?

- Coverage of **all basic design problems** (as many as possible), starting with Excel implementations
- Gradual porting of tools to **Python**
- Potential for **auto-generated drawings** based on calculation resultsâ€”purely aspirational, as of now
